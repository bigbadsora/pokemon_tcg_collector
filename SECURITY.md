# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
This is an alpha, self-hosted project. I actively maintain the **latest `main`** and the most recent release (e.g., `v0.x.y`). Please file reports against those versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report security issues **privately** so I can fix them before public disclosure.

- **Preferred:** Discord DM — `@elsoragigante#7802`
- **Alternative:** GitHub Security Advisory (private):  
  Go to **Security → Report a vulnerability** in this repo and open a draft advisory.
- **Email (noreply):** `186429787+bigbadsora@users.noreply.github.com`

I’ll acknowledge receipt within **3 business days**, share a remediation plan, and aim to release a fix within **14 days** for high-impact issues. After a fix is available, I’ll coordinate a disclosure timeline with you (usually within **7 days**).

## Scope
- This repository’s source code and Docker setup.
- No bounty program; responsible disclosure appreciated.

## Out of Scope
- Third-party services or APIs (e.g., pokemontcg.io), your own deployment misconfigurations, or issues caused by modified forks.

## Public Disclosure
Please don’t create public issues for security problems. Use the private channels above. I’ll publish release notes and credit reporters if desired.
